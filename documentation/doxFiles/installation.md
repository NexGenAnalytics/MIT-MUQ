# Getting MUQ
MUQ currently supports Linux and OSX systems.  We do not currently support Windows, but let us know if that is important to you and we may consider it in the future.

On Linux or OSX, there are three primary ways of installing MUQ:
 1. Using the \c muq conda package from the conda-forge channel.  (See instructions below.)
 2. Using the \c muq docker image.
 3. Installing MUQ from source.

# Building from source
 MUQ2 is hosted on <a href=https://bitbucket.org/mituq/muq2>BitBucket</a>.  To get the source code, you can clone our git repository by running
 ```
 git clone https://bitbucket.org/mituq/muq2
 ```
 While it is usually better to clone MUQ so you can easily obtain updates and bugfixes, you can also download a version of MUQ <a href=https://bitbucket.org/mituq/muq2/downloads>here</a>.
